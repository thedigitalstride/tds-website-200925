# Database Migration Workflow

## üö® CRITICAL: Two Different Strategies

This project uses **different database strategies** for development and production:

- **Development**: Payload auto-syncs schema (push strategy)
- **Production**: Explicit migrations (migrate strategy)

**‚õî Mixing these strategies causes database corruption.**

## üö´ NEVER - Development Environment

### Commands to NEVER Run in Development

1. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate` - Production only
2. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate:create` - Only when preparing for production deployment
3. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate:down` - Causes corruption
4. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate:status` - Implies you might run migrations
5. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate:refresh` - Destructive
6. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate:reset` - Destructive
7. ‚ùå `pnpm payload migrate:fresh` - Deletes all data

### Never Attempt To

- ‚ùå "Fix" database schema errors by running migrations
- ‚ùå Assume migrations are the solution to build errors
- ‚ùå Use external database tools (pgAdmin, DataGrip, raw SQL) for schema changes

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS - Development Environment

### Required Behavior

1. ‚úÖ Let Payload's dev mode auto-sync schema changes (automatic, zero intervention)
2. ‚úÖ Start dev server (`pnpm dev`) when schema is out of sync
3. ‚úÖ Wait for dev server to complete auto-sync before testing builds
4. ‚úÖ Ask user before touching ANY migration command

## üî¥ Critical Error Recognition

### Error Patterns During `pnpm build`

- ‚ùå "column [name] does not exist"
- ‚ùå "relation [name] does not exist"
- ‚ùå "type [name] does not exist"
- ‚ùå "Failed query: select..."

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Response

```bash
# 1. Start dev server to auto-sync schema
pnpm dev

# 2. Wait for Payload to auto-sync (watch console output)
# Look for: "‚úì Schema synchronized with database"

# 3. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)

# 4. Try build again
pnpm build

# 5. NEVER run migration commands
```

### ‚ùå INCORRECT Response

```bash
# DO NOT DO THIS
pnpm payload migrate           # ‚ùå
pnpm payload migrate:create    # ‚ùå
pnpm payload migrate:status    # ‚ùå
# Attempting to manually fix database  # ‚ùå
```

## üéØ Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

### Making Schema Changes

```bash
# 1. Make schema changes in code (collections, fields, etc.)
# Example: Add new field to Pages collection

# 2. Start dev server - Payload auto-syncs schema automatically
pnpm dev

# 3. Payload detects changes and applies them automatically
# Watch console: "‚úì Schema synchronized with database"
# NO MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED

# 4. Test your changes in the admin panel
# Navigate to /admin and verify new fields appear

# 5. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)

# 6. Build to verify everything works
pnpm build

# IF BUILD FAILS WITH SCHEMA ERRORS:
# - Start dev server again (pnpm dev)
# - Let it complete auto-sync
# - Stop dev server
# - Try build again
# DO NOT RUN MIGRATIONS
```

## üìã Production Deployment Workflow

**‚ö†Ô∏è This section is for the USER to follow manually, NOT for AI agents to execute.**

### Phase 1: Local Development (Daily Work)

```bash
# 1. Make your code changes (collections, fields, etc.)

# 2. Start dev server - it auto-syncs schema
pnpm dev
# Watch console: "‚úì Schema synchronized with database"

# 3. Test your changes locally
# Everything works? Great! Dev database is auto-synced

# 4. Build to verify
pnpm build
# Should succeed if dev server synced properly
```

### Phase 2: Preparing for Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. STOP dev server completely (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Create migration for production
pnpm payload migrate:create

# 3. You'll see a prompt:
# "Name this migration (optional):"
# Enter descriptive name like: "add_blog_categories"
# Or press Enter for timestamp-based name

# 4. Check what was created
ls src/migrations/
# You'll see new files:
# - 20251004_XXXXXX_your_name.ts (migration code)
# - 20251004_XXXXXX_your_name.json (migration metadata)

# 5. Review the migration file
# Open the .ts file and check it captured your changes

# 6. Commit BOTH migration files
git add src/migrations/
git commit -m "feat: add migration for [your changes]"

# 7. Push to your branch
git push origin your-branch
```

### Phase 3: Vercel Deployment (Automatic)

When you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically runs:

```bash
# From package.json "ci" script
payload migrate && pnpm build

# This:
# 1. Applies your new migration to production database
# 2. Updates the schema
# 3. Builds the application
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "Column does not exist" in local build

**Solution**:
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server
# Wait 5-10 seconds for auto-sync
# Watch for: "‚úì Schema synchronized with database"
# Ctrl+C to stop
pnpm build       # Try build again
```

### Problem: "invalid input value for enum" Error

**Symptoms**:
```
Error: invalid input value for enum enum_table_column: "deprecated-value"
Failed query: ALTER TABLE "table" ALTER COLUMN "column" SET DATA TYPE...
```

**Root Cause**:
- Dev mode auto-syncs enum TYPE definition (removes deprecated values)
- BUT does NOT update existing DATA using deprecated values
- Database has data with values that no longer exist in the enum type

**Solution for Development**:

1. Identify which tables have deprecated enum values

2. Update data directly using Docker/psql:

```bash
# Check what values exist in the data
docker exec <postgres-container> psql -U postgres -d <database> -c \
  "SELECT enum_column, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY enum_column"

# Update deprecated values to new values
docker exec <postgres-container> psql -U postgres -d <database> -c \
  "UPDATE table_name SET enum_column = 'new-value'
   WHERE enum_column IN ('old-value-1', 'old-value-2')"

# Don't forget version history tables (prefixed with _)
docker exec <postgres-container> psql -U postgres -d <database> -c \
  "UPDATE _table_name_v SET enum_column = 'new-value'
   WHERE enum_column IN ('old-value-1', 'old-value-2')"
```

3. Restart dev server - should start cleanly without errors

**Solution for Production**:

Create a data migration that:
1. Updates data first (transform deprecated values to new values)
2. Then alters enum type (remove deprecated values from type)

**Example**: See `/src/migrations/20251004_update_button_colors.ts`

**Prevention**:
- When removing enum values from code, create migration BEFORE deploying
- Migration should handle both data transformation AND type changes
- Test locally by checking for deprecated data before pushing

### Problem: Forgot to create migration before deploying

**Symptoms**:
```
# In Vercel logs:
Error: column xyz does not exist
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Create migration locally
pnpm payload migrate:create

# Commit and push
git add src/migrations/
git commit -m "fix: add missing migration"
git push  # Triggers redeploy
```

---

### Problem: Migration failed in production

**Steps**:
1. Check Vercel function logs for error details
2. Common fixes:
   - **Data transformation issue**: Edit migration file locally, commit, push
   - **Timeout**: Split into smaller migrations
   - **Critical failure**: May need database backup restore

## üö® When Database is Corrupted

**If migrations were run incorrectly in development and database is corrupted:**

### Step 1: STOP

Do not run any more migration commands.

### Step 2: ASK USER

Explain situation:

> "I incorrectly ran migrations in development. Database may be corrupted. Options are:
> - Option A: `migrate:fresh` (DELETES ALL DATA, clean slate)
> - Option B: Restore from backup if available"

### Step 3: WAIT FOR USER DECISION

Do not proceed without explicit permission.

### Step 4: NEVER

Attempt to "fix" by running more migrations.

## üéì Why These Rules Exist

### Dev Mode: Push Strategy

Payload automatically syncs schema changes to database. No migration tracking.

### Production: Migrate Strategy

Explicit migrations track and apply changes safely. Full audit trail.

### Mixing Strategies = Corruption

Database gets stuck between auto-sync and migration tracking. Recovery requires dropping database or restoring backup.

### Recovery is Destructive

Once corrupted, only options are:
- Drop database and recreate (lose all data)
- Restore from backup (lose changes since backup)

## üìã Migration Commands Reference

**‚ö†Ô∏è ALL OF THESE ARE PRODUCTION-ONLY COMMANDS**

**DO NOT USE IN DEVELOPMENT UNLESS USER EXPLICITLY REQUESTS**

```bash
pnpm payload migrate:create    # Create new migration (production prep only)
pnpm payload migrate          # Run pending migrations (production only)
pnpm payload migrate:status   # Check migration status (production only)
pnpm payload migrate:down     # Rollback last migration (production only)
pnpm payload migrate:refresh  # Rollback and re-run (production only)
pnpm payload migrate:reset    # Rollback all migrations (DESTRUCTIVE)
pnpm payload migrate:fresh    # Drop and recreate schema (DESTRUCTIVE)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Summary for Claude Code Agents

### Your Job: Build Errors with "column does not exist"

1. Recognize this as schema out of sync
2. Start dev server to auto-sync schema
3. Wait for sync to complete
4. Try build again
5. **DO NOT TOUCH MIGRATION COMMANDS**

### Your Job is NOT

1. ‚ùå To run migrations
2. ‚ùå To "fix" the database
3. ‚ùå To check migration status
4. ‚ùå To create migrations (unless preparing for production deployment)
5. ‚ùå To assume migrations are needed
