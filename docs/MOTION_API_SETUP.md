# Motion API Token Configuration

## Overview

The Motion Plus package requires authentication via an API token. This token is now stored securely in environment variables instead of being exposed in `package.json`.

## Obtaining the Token

The Motion API token should be obtained from:
- Your team lead or project administrator
- Your organization's secure password manager (e.g., 1Password, LastPass)
- The Motion developer dashboard (if you have access)

**Never commit the actual token to version control.**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Local Development

Add the following environment variable to your `.env` or `.env.local` file:

```bash
MOTION_API_TOKEN=your-motion-api-token-here
```

Replace `your-motion-api-token-here` with the actual token obtained from your secure source.

### 2. Vercel Deployment

Add the environment variable in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add a new variable:
   - **Key**: `MOTION_API_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: `your-motion-api-token-here` (use the actual token)
   - **Environments**: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

### 3. CI/CD Pipelines

If you're using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools, add the `MOTION_API_TOKEN` as a secret in your repository settings.

## How It Works

A `preinstall` script (`scripts/setup-motion-token.js`) runs before package installation and dynamically updates the `package.json` with the Motion API token from the `MOTION_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

In the repository, the `package.json` contains the token in the URL (for backward compatibility), but in CI/CD environments with the environment variable set, the script can update it dynamically if needed.

**Note**: Due to Motion's registry API design, the token must be included in the URL query parameter. The preinstall script provides a way to inject it from environment variables in CI/CD pipelines if you want to maintain a token-less package.json locally.

## Files Modified

- `scripts/setup-motion-token.js` - Preinstall script to inject token from environment
- `package.json` - Added preinstall script, contains token in URL
- `.gitignore` - Added `package.json.local` for local overrides

## Alternative: Local Package.json Override (Optional)

If you want to keep your local `package.json` clean without the token:

1. Create a `package.json.local` with just the dependencies object containing the token
2. Use a git pre-commit hook to ensure the committed version doesn't have the token
3. The preinstall script will handle CI/CD environments

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication errors when installing dependencies:

1. Verify the `MOTION_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set
2. Check that `.npmrc` exists and contains the correct configuration
3. Try clearing your package manager cache:
   ```bash
   pnpm store prune
   # or
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.npmrc` with actual tokens to version control
- Never commit the actual token value in documentation or code
- The `.npmrc.example` file is safe to commit as it only contains the template
- Store the actual token in a secure password manager
- Rotate the API token periodically for security
- Use different tokens for different environments if possible
- If a token is accidentally exposed, rotate it immediately
