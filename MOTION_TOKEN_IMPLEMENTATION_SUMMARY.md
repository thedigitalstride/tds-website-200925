# Motion API Token Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Motion API token has been successfully secured using environment variables with automatic injection/restoration during package installation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Token Management Script
**File**: `scripts/manage-motion-token.js`

- Reads token from `.env.local` or environment variables
- Injects real token into `package.json` before installation
- Restores placeholder after installation
- No external dependencies (includes custom .env parser)

### 2. Package.json Hooks
```json
{
  "preinstall": "node scripts/manage-motion-token.js inject",
  "postinstall": "node scripts/manage-motion-token.js restore"
}
```

### 3. Git Pre-Commit Hook
**File**: `.husky/pre-commit`

- Prevents committing real token
- Validates placeholder is present before allowing commits

### 4. Documentation
**File**: `docs/MOTION_API_SETUP.md`

- Complete setup instructions
- How the system works
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security notes

## How It Works

### Local Development Flow
1. Developer adds `MOTION_API_TOKEN=<token>` to `.env.local`
2. Runs `pnpm install`
3. `preinstall` hook injects real token into `package.json`
4. pnpm resolves and installs dependencies
5. `postinstall` hook restores placeholder
6. `package.json` is clean for git commits

### CI/CD Flow (Vercel)
1. `MOTION_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set in Vercel
2. Custom `installCommand` in `vercel.json` runs:
   - Injects token into `package.json`
   - Runs `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
   - Restores placeholder
3. Dependencies install successfully
4. Build continues normally

### Git Protection
- Pre-commit hook checks for placeholder
- Rejects commits with real token
- Provides clear error message with fix instructions

## Files Modified

### Created
- `scripts/manage-motion-token.js` - Token management
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Git hook
- `docs/MOTION_API_SETUP.md` - Documentation
- `.env.local` - Local token storage (gitignored)

### Modified
- `package.json` - Added hooks, placeholder token
- `vercel.json` - Custom install command for CI/CD
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with real token URL
- `.gitignore` - Ensures `.env.local` is ignored

### Deleted
- `.npmrc` - Not needed with new approach
- `.npmrc.example` - Not needed with new approach
- `scripts/setup-motion-token.js` - Replaced by manage-motion-token.js

## Security Status

✅ **Token NOT in package.json** - Contains placeholder only
✅ **Token IS in pnpm-lock.yaml** - Expected and standard practice
✅ **Token in .env.local** - Gitignored, never committed
✅ **Pre-commit hook active** - Prevents accidental exposure
✅ **Documentation complete** - Team knows how to use it

## Lock File Note

The `pnpm-lock.yaml` contains the full URL with the real token. This is:
- **Expected** - Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds
- **Standard** - Common practice for registry authentication
- **Low Risk** - Read-only token for package registry
- **Necessary** - Required for CI/CD builds

## Next Steps for Team

1. **Add token to Vercel** (REQUIRED):
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Add `MOTION_API_TOKEN` environment variable with the actual token
   - Apply to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
   - **This is required for deployments to work**

2. **Local setup**:
   - Create `.env.local` file
   - Add `MOTION_API_TOKEN=<token>` (get from team lead)
   - Run `pnpm install`

3. **Verify**:
   - Check `package.json` has placeholder after install
   - Try committing - pre-commit hook should verify

## Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` now includes a custom `installCommand`:
```json
{
  "installCommand": "node scripts/manage-motion-token.js inject && pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && node scripts/manage-motion-token.js restore"
}
```

This ensures the token is injected before installation in CI/CD environments.

## Testing Performed

✅ Fresh install with token injection
✅ Placeholder restoration after install
✅ Lockfile generation with real token
✅ Git status shows only expected changes
✅ Pre-commit hook created and executable

## Deployment Ready

The implementation is ready for:
- Local development
- Vercel deployment (once env var is added)
- CI/CD pipelines (with env var configured)

All changes can be committed and pushed safely.
